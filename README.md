# translateSrt
Simple nodejs script to translate an SRT file. 

At the moment it uses the Google Translate API to translate the subtitles from a language to English. 

I used this to translate from chinese to English. 

File names it reads from and writes to are hardcoded in the script at the moment but you could change these and pass them in as arguments to make it more flexible.

#### To run:

1. Clone the repo
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `node translateSrt.js`
